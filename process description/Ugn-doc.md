# Refinery Fired Heaters: Essential Reference

## Overview

Fired heaters are specialized direct-fired heat exchangers used in refineries and petrochemical plants to heat or vaporize hydrocarbon fluids to precise temperatures for chemical or physical transformations.

## 1. Structural Configurations (API 560)

The American Petroleum Institute (API) Standard 560 defines several heater styles, with three being most common in modern industry:

* **Vertical Cylindrical (VC):** Features vertical serpentine coils arranged in a circle within a tall, cylindrical firing section. This is the most common design due to its cost efficiency and small footprint.


* **Cabin Heater:** Uses horizontal or vertical radiant coils within a box-like firing box, often with slanted upper walls. This is the preferred choice for crude distillation because horizontal tubes can be easily drained for maintenance.


* **Box Heater:** A rectangular structure using vertical or horizontal coils. This layout is highly scalable and capable of mounting very large convection sections for high-duty requirements.



## 2. Functional Application Types

* **Crude Charge Heaters:** Large-duty units that heat desalted crude oil to approximately 700 F for entry into atmospheric distillation columns.


* **Vacuum Heaters:** Process heavy residues from distillation. They operate at low pressures and higher temperatures (up to 800 F), requiring large-bore tubes to manage near-sonic fluid velocities.


* **Delayed Coker Heaters:** Specifically designed to heat heavy residual oil to thermal cracking temperatures. These units must manage the buildup of internal coke (carbon deposits) on the tube walls.


* **Reboiler Heaters:** Heat exchangers that vaporize liquid from the bottom of distillation columns to drive component separation.



## 3. Specialty Reaction Furnaces

* **Steam Methane Reformers (SMR):** Furnaces containing long, catalyst-filled tubes used for hydrogen production. Firing arrangements include **top-fired** (downward firing), **side-fired** (even heat distribution along walls), and **terrace-wall fired**.
* **Ethylene Pyrolysis Furnaces:** High-temperature reactors that crack naphtha or gas into olefins. They feature ultra-short residence times (0.1 to 0.2 seconds) and rapid quenching systems to prevent unwanted secondary reactions.

## 4. Primary Components for 3D Modeling

* **Radiant Section (Firebox):** The insulated core where combustion occurs. Tubes are heated primarily by radiation from burner flames and incandescent refractory walls.
* **Convection Section:** Located above the radiant section, where hot flue gases preheat the incoming fluid. Tubes here are often "extended" with fins or studs to increase surface area.
* **Shield (Shock) Section:** Several rows of bare tubes located between the radiant and convection sections to protect the latter from direct radiant heat.
* **Burner Systems:** Devices that introduce fuel and air. They are categorized by firing direction: **Up-firing** (floor-mounted), **Down-firing** (roof-mounted), or **Side-wall firing**.
* **Stack and Breeching:** The ducting (breeching) and vertical chimney (stack) used to discharge flue gases and generate the "draft" (negative pressure) required for safe operation.
